# Front-end Nanodegree Clasic Arcade Game Clone
===============================

### Summary

Frogger Arcade is a variation of the classic Frogger arcade game.

### Frogger Game Description:

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal is simple, get the hero character to move across the gray bricks towards the water without getting hit by the enemy bugs. The user's score increases by one point for each level passed. The number of enemy bugs also increase with each level and are randomly placed across the gray bricks at the start of each game. 

The enemies move in varying speeds on the gray bricks. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

### To play the game:

- Use arrows to move your hero character by using up/down/right/left on your keyboard
- Avoid the enemies dashing from left to right over the gray bricks
- The grass tiles are safe
